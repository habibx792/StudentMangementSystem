The Student Management System (SMS) is a C++ console-based application designed to manage student records, courses, attendance, results, and fees. It provides a visualized structure of data management using Binary Search Trees (BSTs), queues, and other data structures to efficiently handle CRUD operations. This project demonstrates data structure manipulation, database connectivity, and software design principles.
